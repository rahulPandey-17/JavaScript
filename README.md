# JavaScript Daily Learning Progress

Welcome to my **JavaScript Daily Learning Progress** repository! ðŸš€ This repository tracks my daily journey of learning JavaScript, where I document and share my growth as a developer.

## About the Project

Every day, I commit new code or learning materials that represent what I've learned or practiced. This is part of my ongoing effort to build a solid foundation in JavaScript programming, covering everything from the basics to advanced topics.

## Learning Goals

- Understand core JavaScript concepts like variables, functions, and loops.
- Explore advanced topics such as ES6+, async programming, and JavaScript frameworks.
- Implement practical projects to solidify my knowledge.
- Build the foundation for working with frontend and backend JavaScript technologies.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the folders and look at the code for each day. If you're also learning JavaScript, you can use this as a reference or even follow along with your own journey.
